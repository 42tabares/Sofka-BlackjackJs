Welcome to Blackjack! a project produced by Juan Jose Tabares

In this game you can play with up to 4 players the classic Blackjack game, fully programmed on NodeJs!!

To install follow these steps:
> * clone repository
> * make sure you have npm installed!
> * Run command: _npm start_ in console from VScode!

## Players

play with up to 4 players, select their names!

## Game!

Each player starts with 5000$ cash! players receive 2 cards at the start of a round, an Ace count as 11 or as 1 at the player's convenience (don't worry, the program calculates it automatically ;) )

Players can either FREEZE or TAKE A CARD at the start of a round
- if they FREEZE they wont be able to take more cards, but they wont lose money!
- if the player gets EXACTLY 21 they got a BLACKJACK! and win 100$ instantly!!
- if they TAKE A CARD they could get closer to 21 and win...!
- if two players are in a tie they get 1000$ each!
- if the player's card value passes 21 the player is ELIMINATED and loses 1000$ !


At the end, when no one else can take cards the player with cards closer to 21 will win 1000$!

## KNOWN ISSUES
- ~~For now, Ties result on the first selected player winning the match, it's easy to solve but the time for delivery is almost over :(~~
FIXED!!
